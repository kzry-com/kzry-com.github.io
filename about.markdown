This is Kuzuryu. A home for documenting personal projects, tech or not, for myself or not. 

Name choice [Kuzuryu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuzury%C5%AB) is inspired by legendary 9-Headed-Dragon on lake Hakone. You can follow the Wiki link and learn about it, or google it. For me its: a "Multi-Themed" Dragon to be tamed, that likes [Sekihan](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sekihan)
